## Tida Data Code Book

#### Introduction
This code book aims to help the user understand the data produced by the 
run_analysis.R script.

#### Prerequisites
In order to fully understand the scope of the dataset and the experiment that
produced it, please take the time to read the official [README](https://github.com/locrawl/datasciencecoursera/tree/master/Tidy%20Data/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset)

#### Measures Explanation
The **TidyData.txt** file exported by the run_analysis.R script will contain
the following 81 columns:

Subject - Represents the subject ID of the 30 participants 

Activity - LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS

The remaining 79 measures are **ALL AVERAGES** of the original measure names.
NOTE: Per the project instructions, the original 561 measures were filtered to
only include those measures that contain mean or standard deviation data. It was
not specified however if this meant only measures that contained mean() or simply
mean, so the run_analysis.R script finds all measure names containing the strings
"mean" and "std". This is to allow for future expansion of the dataset to include
new measures without having to rewrite the script.
